Introduction

|RS_JSON_TSFM_TM| provides a way of transforming DDS types into a JSON string
(using standard DDS-JSON mapping), and store the result in one of the supported
datatypes, check these datatypes in the section :ref:`section-how-to-load-plugin`.

It also allows to parse the contents of the supported datatypes fields in
the input sample as a JSON object, and set the values of the corresponding
fields in the output sample.
