Release Notes
=============

New features
------------

#. Introduced support for a wider range of input/output members when converting
   between JSON and DynamicData representations.
#. The type of the member specified by property |PROP_BUFFER_MEMBER| can
   now be any of the following "string-like" types:

   * ``string``
   * ``sequence<octet>``
   * ``sequence<char>``
   * ``octet[N]``
   * ``char[N]``

#. Improved resource management. This implies the deletion of the following
   properties:

   * *serialized_size_max*
   * *serialized_size_incr*

   Deprecated:

   * *serialized_size_min*

   And added a new property:

   * |PROP_UNBOUNDED_MEMBER_SERIALIZED_SIZE_INITIAL|

   This new property represents the initial allocated size when using unbounded
   sequences and strings.
