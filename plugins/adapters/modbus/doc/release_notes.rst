Release Notes
=============

New features (September 2021)
-----------------------------

#. Support for Modbus RTU slaves devices. These devices are identified by the
   JSON configuration attribute |CONF_MODBUS_SLAVE_DEVICE_ID|.
#. Support for new constant datatypes. Primitive types, enums and, arrays of
   the previous types are now allowed values for the JSON configuration
   attribute |CONF_VALUE|.

Bug fixes (September 2021)
--------------------------

#. Unexpected behavior when using negative values in the JSON configuration
   attributes |CONF_MODBUS_MIN_VALUE| and |CONF_MODBUS_MAX_VALUE| if the DDS
   field was unsigned. Now an error is thrown when this happens.
