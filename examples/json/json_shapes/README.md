# Example JSON Shapes

## Description of the Example

This example shows how to translate a Dynamic Data object of type
`ShapeTypeExtended` to a string containing its DDS-JSON representation and vice
versa.

The IDL definition for `ShapeTypeExtended` is:

```idl
enum ShapeFillKind {
    SOLID_FILL,
    TRANSPARENT_FILL,
    HORIZONTAL_HATCH_FILL,
    VERTICAL_HATCH_FILL
};

struct ShapeType
{
    string<128> color; //@key
    long x;
    long y;
    long shapesize;
};//@Extensibility EXTENSIBLE_EXTENSIBILITY

struct ShapeTypeExtended : ShapeType {
    ShapeFillKind fillKind;
    float angle;
};//@Extensibility EXTENSIBLE_EXTENSIBILITY

```

The JSON plugin can use any _string-like_ field of a Dynamic Data object to
store and read a DDS-JSON representation. The target field can be any of the
following types:

* `string`
* `sequence<octet>`
* `sequence<char>`
* `octet[N]`
* `char[N]`

The example uses type `MessagePayload` to store DDS-JSON representations:

```idl
struct MessagePayload {
    string data;    //@ID 0
};
//@Extensibility EXTENSIBLE_EXTENSIBILITY
```

### Routing Service Configuration

The example provides two Routing Service configurations in file
[RsJsonShapes.xml](examples/json/json_shapes/RsJsonShapes.xml) which demonstrate
the use of the JSON plugin in both directions:

- `ShapeToJson`
  - Read `ShapeTypeExtended` samples from topic `Square` on domain `0`, convert
    them to DDS-JSON, store the result in `MessagePayload::data`, and publish
    `MessagePayload` to topic `SquareJson` on domain `1`.
- `JsonToShape`
  - Read `MessagePayload` samples from topic `SquareJson` on domain `1`, convert
    `MessagePayload::data` to `ShapeTypeExtended`, publish `ShapeTypeExtended`
    to topic `Circle` on domain `2`.


## Running the Example

Start two instances of RTI Shapes Demo:
- Shapes Demo 1:
  - Go to *Controls > Configuration*, and make sure the domain ID is `0`.
  - Start publishing a `Square` with default options ("BLUE" color).
- Shapes Demo 2:
  - Go to *Controls > Configuration*, and change the domain ID to `2`.
  - Subscribe to topic `Circle` with default options.

In two separate terminals, start two Routing Service instances:

- `ShapeToJson`:

  ```sh
  cd examples/json/json_shapes
  rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsJsonShapes.xml -cfgName ShapeToJson
  ```

- `JsonToShape`:

  ```sh
  cd examples/json/json_shapes
  rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsJsonShapes.xml -cfgName JsonToShape
  ```

> **NOTE**: the `rtijsontransf` library should be reachable by the OS. Add the
> corresponding folders to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH` or
> `RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable (depending on your OS). If you
> followed the default building instructions, the folder to include is:
> `<path to rticonnextdds-gateway>/install/lib`.

At this time, you should see a BLUE circle in the _Shape Demo 2_.

Additionally you may want to see what is sent to the topic `SquareJSON` in the
domain ID 1 by using RTI Admin Console or RTI DDS Spy. For example, using
RTI DDS Spy you will see an output similar to:

> 1623083351.947987  d +M  0A3200CA    SquareJSON          MessagePayload
> data: "{ "color":"BLUE", "x":92, "y":25, "shapesize":30, "fillKind":"SOLID_FILL", "angle":0 } "

The `RsJsonShapes.xml` configuration file contains alternative data types which
show the use of other _string-like_ types as containers for DDS-JSON
representations.

If you want to test these different data types, you can comment the `<types>`
tag in the XML file, and enable one of the alternative definitions which are
commented out by default.
