class Processor(ABC):
    """ Processor interface definition.

    Provides a way to process Route events and control the data forwarding
    process.

    A Processor receives event notifications from its Route owner in the form
    of operation callbacks. Each event occurrence will be dispatched to the
    Processor by calling the corresponding method.

    Each dispatching method has a signature according to the event kind and
    data it is associated with. Each event is associated with a Route state;
    hence limitations and constraints may apply individually to each method.

    Note that throwing an exception while processing any of the event
    notifications is allowed. In this situation, the Route owner will reject
    the events and none of the associated post conditions will be applied,
    including state transitions.

    Multi-threading safety:
    Partially Safe All operations on a concrete Processor object are safe and
    always serialized on a given Session. Operations on different Processor
    objects may be called concurrently if they belong to different Routes.
